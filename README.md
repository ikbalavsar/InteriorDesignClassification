# InterriorDesignClassification
The aesthetic understanding born with the developing technology forces people to follow the current trends. When this situation is examined in the field of architecture, it has been noticed that people do not have a general knowledge about the design they want to make. In this project, which is considered as a solution to this problem, we aim to classify designs, envision which design style in the user's architectural language and show the pieces that can be used specifically for the user. That is, we aim to reduce the time a person spends decorating their home. At the same time, bringing a new perspective to the interior architecture sector is one of the starting points of our project. CNN, one of the deep learning methods, was used to achieve these goals. Some classical deep learning problems such as overfitting were encountered during the study.
